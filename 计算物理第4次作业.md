#The 4th homework of computational physics
##Problem 1.5:
Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B, while nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A. Strictly speaking, this is not a "decay" process, since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back into type A nuclei. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are  
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dN_A}{dt}=\frac{N_B}{\tau_B}-\frac{N_A}{\tau_A}" alt="" title="" />  
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dN_B}{dt}=\frac{N_A}{\tau_A}-\frac{N_B}{\tau_B}" alt="" title="" />  
where for simplicity we have assumed that the two types of decay are characterized by the same time constant, tau. Solve this system of equation for the numbers of nuclei, NA and NB, as functions of time. Consider different initial conditions, such as NA=100, NB=0, etc, and take tau=1s. Show that your numerical results are consistent with the idea that the system reaches a steady state in which NA and NB are constant. In such a steady state, the time derivatives dNA/dt and dNB/dt should vanish.  
##Abstract  
I use the Euler method to solve this problem since there are two ordinary differential equations in the problem. I scatch the Taylor expansion of the equation we are going to solve first and then drop the second and higher order terms in the equations, which means that I only use it's linear term in it. This is a good approximation for the two equations in the problems. To realize it, I have to program in 4 steps: (1) declear the necessary variables, (2) initialize all variables and parameters, (3) do the calculation, and (4) store the result. Also, I will use different initial conditions to ensure the reliability of my programming.

###Introduction  
(1) To numerically solve the two equations in the problem,we use Taylor expansion for <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U_A" alt="" title="" /> and <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U_B" alt="" title="" /> first like following:   
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_U%28t&plus;%5CDelta%20t%29%3DN_U%28t%29&plus;%5Cfrac%7BdN_U%7D%7Bdt%7D%5CDelta%20t&plus;%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%20N_U%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D%28%5CDelta%20t%29%5E2&plus;...)  
(2) Use the approximation that

(3) Use the equations in the problem to replace <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dN_U}{dt}" alt="" title="" /> and use the initial condition to get the curve.  
(4) Write the code to realize it.
