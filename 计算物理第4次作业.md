#The 4th homework of computational physics
##Abstract
###Problem 1.5:
Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B, while nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A. Strictly speaking, this is not a "decay" process, since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back into type A nuclei. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are
