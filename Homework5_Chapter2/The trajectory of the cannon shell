#The 5th homework of computational physics
##Problem:  
EXERCISES 2.7 (Page 31)  
EXERCISES 2.9 (Page 31)  
EXERCISES 2.10 (Page 31)  
##Abstract  
In last homework, I have already learned the knowledge of the basics of Euler method and used it to solve a simple problem. Now in this Chapter, more complex Ordinary Differential Equations are coming. Again one will discover the power of the method. I will try to use it to calculate the trajectory of the cannon shell. I will try to do exercise 2.7, 2.9 and 2.10 in this homework.  
##Background:  
To solve the ordinary differential equations, Euler method will be used.  
###EXERCISES 2.7  
- Considering the motion of a cannon shell without air drag:  
Using the Newton's second law, we have the following equations:
